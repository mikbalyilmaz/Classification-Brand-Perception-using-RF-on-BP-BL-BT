# Classification Brand Perception Using Random Forest: Brand Preference (BP), Brand Loyalty (BL) and, Brand Trust (BT)
Brands enable strategy development, competitive advantage, and audience connection in modern society. This study addresses gaps in Brand Preference (BP), Brand Loyalty (BL), and Brand Trust (BT) among university students using Machine Learning (ML), particularly Random Forest (RF) Classification. Data from Ankara Hacı Bayram Veli University (Spring 2023/2024) is analyzed with decision tree classifiers. A meta-predictor reduces overfitting, while the ’Brand Perception Scale’, with 22 independent variables ( ), assesses BP, BL, and BT.

## About the Project  
This repository contains the code and resources from my research paper *"Classification of Brand Perception Using Random Forest: Brand Preference, Brand Loyalty, and Brand Trust"* presented at **IDSSC’24** and published in the Proceedings Book.  

The study investigates how university students’ **brand preference, loyalty, and trust** can be modeled through **Random Forest classification**, addressing class imbalance with **SMOTE**. The dataset includes 22 independent variables, such as demographics, income, fashion, design, and social media engagement.  

## 🔍 Key Highlights  
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest (multi-class classification)  
- **Data Handling:** Class imbalance solved with SMOTE  
- **Sample Size:** 407 undergraduate students  
- **Variables:** 22 predictors including demographics, income, brand monitoring, social media use  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- **Findings:**  
  - Social media, fashion, and design strongly affect **brand preference**  
  - Design, online shopping, and product recency drive **brand loyalty**  
  - Trust is influenced by online shopping, recognizability, and income  

## Visualizations  
Decision trees and feature importance plots were generated to illustrate how independent variables shape **brand perception constructs**.
